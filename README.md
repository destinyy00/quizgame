# Quiz Game

A small JavaScript quiz game that loads questions from `questions.json`, shows one question at a time, includes a per-question timer, and saves high scores to `localStorage` (leaderboard).

Features
- Loads questions dynamically from `questions.json`.
- Shows one question at a time with selectable choices.
- Provides immediate feedback (correct/incorrect) and updates the score.
- 20-second timer per question; times out to show correct answer and allows moving to the next question.
- Leaderboard stored in `localStorage` (top 10 scores).
- Responsive, minimal UI.

Testing
- A simple Node script validates the JSON format (questions present and fields exist).
A minimal Quiz Game repository. This project contains a small JavaScript quiz that loads questions from a JSON file and displays them in the browser. The repository includes source files, a sample questions file, and a basic test script.

The README intentionally omits local run instructions.
